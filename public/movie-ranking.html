<h1>The Best Movies According to Masalad</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>300</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. I like how it feels like action, adventure, war and superhero all in one movie.</p>
<h3>Law abiding Citizen</h3>
<p>Cool crime fiction. i like how they made it hard to predict anything in this movie.</p>
<h3>Phone Booth</h3>
<p>This is my all time favourite, i still dont understand how a movie can be concentrated in one thing and still be interesting.</p>
